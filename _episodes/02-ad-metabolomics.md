# Metabolomics data from anerobic digestion

The following experimental design is shown below. In this experiment metabolite samples were prepared from sewage sludge which has been taken from anaerobic digesters. Anaerobic digestion is the process of using microbes to break down organic material to generate biogas which can be used as a renewable energy source. The samples are prepared to use on a mass spectrometer, which will generate an abundance and the charge/mass ratio for each metabolite it detects. Generating
