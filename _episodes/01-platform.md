# Outline
choice of long vs short reads

depends on your research question

if you have a very good reference - short reads fine, can do lots of samples, thus quite a few exp conditions
if you are doing assemblies - long reads better, then to get depth do few samples
depends on size of genome and one ploidy
eg snp calling on bacteria need not be deep, hetero snps on what - need depth
