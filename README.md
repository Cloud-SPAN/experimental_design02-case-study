## Experimental Design Case Studies

In these three episodes we will be looking at case studies and looking at how these are good or bad examples of experimental designs. We will be covering an RNAseq example, an anerobic digestion metabolomics example and we will also be covering the LTEE dataset.

The module is designed for a 2 - 3 hour workshop. 

The Statistically useful experimental design module comprises 3 GitHub repositories:
1. [The Overview repository](https://github.com/Cloud-SPAN/experimental_design00-overview) for webpages at https://cloud-span.github.io/experimental_design00-overview/
2. [Principles of experimental design](https://github.com/Cloud-SPAN/experimental_design01-principles) for webpages at https://cloud-span.github.io/experimental_design01-principles/
3. [Case Studies in Experimental Design](https://github.com/Cloud-SPAN/experimental_design02-case-study) for webpages at https://cloud-span.github.io/experimental_design02-case-study/

The site infrastructure is based on [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)

## About Cloud-SPAN

Cloud-SPAN is a collaboration between the [Department of Biology, University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) and [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) funded by the UKRI innovation scholars award (Project Reference: [MR/V038680/1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgtr.ukri.org%2Fprojects%3Fref%3DMR%252FV038680%252F1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF0nsozFp-1kvcp0Dgjks6kY8CiCQ)) which trains researchers, and the research software engineers that support them, to run specialised analyses on cloud-based high-performance computing infrastructure
